    "## 4. In what ways are C++ strings better than C strings? In what ways are C strings better than C++ strings?\n",
    "- C++ strings are better, in a way that it has useful methods such as .length, and it is string object just like java string, and it is safer.\n",
    "- C strings are better when you're writing super light weight code, or using standard C++ library some of which only accepts C string as argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. What is the difference between a pointer and a reference?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pointer needs dereferencing operation to get the value stored in the variable, however reference automattically dereference and return value when needed, which makes it convenient for passing for methods.\n",
    "- On the other hand, it's better practice to use pointer to declare new heap data, since it has to be deleted after its use.\n",
