    "## 1. What is wrong wtih the following code and how would you fix it?\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "int min;\n",
    "for(int i=0; i<10; ++i) {\n",
    "    int value;\n",
    "    scanf(\"%d\", &value);\n",
    "    if(i=0) min = value;\n",
    "    else if(value<min) min = value;\n",
    "} // end of loop over input\n",
    "printf(\"The smallest or the 10 values you entered was %d\\n\", min);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`if` statement is using only one `=`, instead use 2`=`, `if(i==0)..`\n",

    "## 2. What is wrong with the following code and how would you fix it?\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "int* pointerToMax(int a, int b) {\n",
    "    if(a>b) return &a;\n",
    "    else    return &b;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Problem is that this method is inputting int itself, not a pointer to the int. Thefore I'd import pointer to the int a and b instead, and change it to..\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "int* pointerToMax(int* a, int* b){\n",
    "    if(*a>*b) return a;\n",
    "    else      return b;\n",

    "## 3. What's wrong with the following code and how would you fix it?\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "int* ptr = NULL;\n",
    "scanf(\"%d\", ptr);\n",
    "printf(\"You entered %d\", &ptr)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- There are several problems with the code.\n",
    "1. `ptr` is not initalized to point any variables, therefore it can be pointing at random locations in the memory, possibly causing it to raise segmentation fault. \n",
    "2. No print statement before the `scanf`, can be confusing to users of the program\n",
    "3. `;` is missing on the end of the last line as well as `&` is used to reference? the value in `ptr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution would be..\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "int usr_in; // create var that ptr points to.\n",
    "int* ptr = &usr_in; // initialize the ptr.\n",
    "scanf(\"%d\", ptr);\n",
    "printf(\"You entered %d\", usr_in); // or printf(\"You entered %d\", *ptr);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or...\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "int usr_in;\n",
    "printf(\"enter an int: \");\n",
    "scanf(\"%d\", &usr_in);\n",
    "printf(\"You've entered %d\", usr_in);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Describe what each of the following declare:\n",
    "1. `int* a;`: pointer `a` to int value\n",
    "2. `const int b;`: constant integer named b\n",
    "3. `const int* c;`: pointer to const int, pointer is changable, but not the int that is pointing at\n",
    "4. `int* const d;`: const pointer that points at integer. the pointer d can't be changed, but value in the int can be modified.\n",
    "5. `const int* const e;`: constant pointer e, that points to a const integer. Neither pointer or value in the const int are changable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. What is the difference between the * and & operators??\n",
    "- `*`: is dereferencing operator, for example\n",
    "> ```C++\n",
    "     int* ptr; // this initialize a pointer\n",
    "     *ptr; // this is the value that ptr is pointing at.\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "- `&`: is referencing operator, for example\n",
    "> ```C++\n",
    "     int var; //create a variable\n",
    "     &var; // this is a pointer that points at var.\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 6. What is the difference between const int* a and int* const b??\n",
    "\n",
    "- `const int* a`: is pointer to constant integer.\n",
    "- `int* const b`: is a constant pointer that points to an int. \n",
    "\n",
    "Difference here is that one being constant pointer vs the other being pointer, which points at constant int."
